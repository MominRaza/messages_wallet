# Messages Wallet

This open-source Android app simplifies your banking experience by extracting transaction details from SMS messages - all processed directly on your device. Easily view and organize your financial activity in a straightforward list format. Take control of your transactions effortlessly with this user-friendly tool.

Currently it only supports Bank of Baroda messages, and I'm working on Axis Bank messages

If anyone wants me to add support for their bank, then create a issue with some sample transaction messages of your bank.

Feel free to contribute and make it even better! 🚀👩‍💻
